## Possible Assignment 1

Start with `lispb.scala`, and implement FEXPR like in `lispc.scala`
folding in all the special forms. As a warmup, let them add the
primitives in the env needed for the programs to run. After that use
FEXPR to implement variable monitoring, or call/cc. Also, expose the
FEXPR to the surface.
